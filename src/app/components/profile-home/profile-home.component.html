      A Cadmus profile tells the editor about your data architecture. There are
      three main areas here:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>facets</strong> define the data models ("parts") you pick to
        compose your records ("items"). A facet lists all the parts an item can
        (or should) contain. This is not a closed set: you are free to change it
        at any moment, even when you have already entered data. In this way,
        each item has an open, composable data model, resulting from the sum of
        the parts it contains. Further, the same parts can be reused across
        different items, and the same happens for their editing UI.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>flags</strong> are optional tags which can be attached to any
        item, in order to mark it in some meaningful way for editing purposes.
        For instance, you might want to mark an item as to be revised, or
        completed, revised, etc. You can define up to 32 such flags, giving each
        a name, a color, and a description.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>thesauri</strong> are taxonomies you can share across any number
        of data models (parts), wherever users need to pick a value from a
        predefined set. These taxonomies can be simple, "flat" lists, or rather
        hierarchical. In both cases, they are defined as objects having each a
        list of entries. Each entry has an arbitrarily assigned ID, which must
        be unique whithin that object; and a text value to be displayed to the
        user. For instance, you might have a list of languages to pick from,
        like English, French, Italian, etc.: in this case, your thesaurus would
        have its own ID, e.g. <code>languages</code>, plus a number of entries
        like <code>eng</code>=<code>English</code>,
        <code>fre</code>=<code>French</code>,
        <code>ita</code>=<code>Italian</code>, etc. Here I'm using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3" target="_blank"
          >ISO 639 for language codes</a
        >, but IDs are totally arbitrary, even if it's suggested to use some
        standard when available. These are the IDs which will be used internally
        to represent any entry from your taxonomies.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      The profile is a simple JSON text with an object for each of these three
      areas: <code>facets</code>, <code>flags</code>, and <code>thesauri</code>.
