      <blockquote>The reuse mantra: open data modeling</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Cadmus is focused on <em>reuse</em>, for the obvious reason that we can't
      afford creating a new solution from scratch for every project. This is
      true for both data models, and their editing software.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key to reuse is being modular. Like in LEGO buildings, we can create a
      lot of different constructions, by just reusing the same bricks. We just
      need a way of making all the problems look similar, and split them into
      shared pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the Cadmus architecture is modular for both data models and their
      editing software.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Objects ("parts")</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      A very simple analogy you can use to visualize the Cadmus data
      architecture is thinking of a set of objects of <em>any</em> type you want
      to store in an organized way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects represent a semantically coherent, self-contained and virtually
      independent set of data, structured according to its own data model. An
      object is something standing on its own, and having some properties. We
      can have as many object types as we want; there is no limit. In Cadmus,
      these objects are known as <em>parts</em>.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Boxes ("items")</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      To better organize such objects, we put all the related objects in the
      same box. That's the <em>item</em>: our data record. Thus, the item's
      model is not statically defined; rather, it is just the sum of the part it
      contains. So an item has a dynamic and open model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, for better organization we attach a label on each box. This
      corresponds to a set of metadata like title, description, last save time,
      etc., we constantly attach to each item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our items can thus represent anything: an inscription, a person, an
      archaeological artifact, a manuscript, a critical apparatus, a dictionary
      entry... there is no limit to the types of data you may want to store. Of
      course, just like you could not store a whole car in a box, such complex
      items usually are disassembled into smaller, semantically coherent parts.
      So we could store e.g. tires, windows, bumpers, lights, etc. in different
      boxes, up to the level of disassembly we want to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modularity of this architecture also grants its dynamic nature.
      Whenever we want to store new objects, whatever their type, we just grab
      them and toss in one of the boxes. This does not affect all the other
      objects already contained in that box: we don't have to care about what is
      already there, as each object stands by itself. It's just an object that
      we chose to put in a box. In this sense, the object is always equal to
      itself; rather, it's the content of the box which changes whenever we add
      a new object.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Shelves</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Finally, we store our boxes on a set of shelves. These are provided by the
      database infrastructure. The system is not bound to a specific underlying
      storage technology; yet, its implementation relies on a popular NoSql
      database, which proves to be effective when dealing with high-volume and
      dynamically shaped data. At any rate, the underlying storage technology is
      an implementation detail; users need not to trouble with it. In fact,
      given Cadmus layered architecture, you could even swap its data storage
      technology with another one, and the rest of the system would not even be
      aware of it.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Modular software for modular data</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      That's for our data. As for software, each part (our object) has its own
      editing UI. As Cadmus is web-based, that's essentially like a web form.
      Everyone can fill web forms: if you can surf the web, you can use Cadmus.
      Yet, the UI can be as powerful as you want, ranging from a simple web form
      to a full-fledged web application working inside the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, it is essential to emphasize that each part editor is designed for
      reuse, just like the model of the data it edits. So, data is modular; and
      their editor too.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for boxes (the items), they are all created equal: they are just boxes.
      So their editor is unique, too, whatever their content.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Composite modeling</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      This nicely fits with model complexity. In most cases, objects have complex
      structures, where we can identify recurring sub-models. To make a trivial
      example, different objects like an inscription, a literary text, a person,
      a lemma in a dictionary, a coin, etc. all eventually share a datation. So,
      it makes sense designing composite, rather than monolithic models. We
      model our datation once, and reuse it everywhere; and the same happens
      with any other part of a more complex model we might find useful to design
      in isolation, and then compose with other parts.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Taming models complexity: the datation sample</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      This decomposition of items into parts is way of reducing the complexity
      of models, and defining a set of sub-models with such an abstraction level
      to be easily shared, and thus reused, across several different composite
      models (items).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above example, datation might sound an odd example for a complex
      model; but a datation often is much more than a simple number for a year
      or a century, and it effectively requires a structure of its own. For
      instance, consider this expression:
      <em>367/366 B.C.? - ca. 150 A.D. (Roman copy)</em> (found in SEG 46,1531).
      We want to preserve all the nouances of similar expressions, but we also
      want to encode datations in a computable structure, so that a machine can
      sort or filter items according to its value. Click below to see some more
      examples.

        Some datation samples
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <ng-ticker [stopOnHover]="true" speed="20s">
        <p>
          &#x2022; unknown &#x2022; iii century AD &#x2022; before the ii
          century BC &#x2022; after the i century AD (?) &#x2022; between the ii
          and iii century AD &#x2022; about iv-iii century BC &#x2022; May 30,

      </ng-ticker>
    </mat-expansion-panel>
    <br />
    <p>
      We could thus start from this timeline, and place a single point on it to
      cover expressions like "iii century AD", "May 30, 178 BC", "136/5 BC",
      etc.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/img/d1.svg" />
      <legend>
        <p>A single point on a timeline, like <em>178 BC</em>.</p>
      </legend>
    </figure>
    <p>
      By adding another point we can define an interval, which covers
      expressions like "between the ii and iii century AD", "about iv-iii
      century BC", "150-125 BC", "Tiberius reign (14-37 AD)", etc.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/img/d2.svg" />
      <legend>
        <p>
          Two points on the timeline, defining an interval, like
          <em>14-37 AD</em>.
        </p>
      </legend>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Finally, the second point might be <em>somewhere</em> before the first one
      (as a <em>terminus ante</em>); or somewhere after it (as a
      <em>terminus post</em>).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/img/d3.svg" />
      <legend>
        <p>
          Two points on the timeline, defining an interval, where the first
          point is not exactly defined. This is a <em>terminus ante</em>, like
          <em>before 31 AD</em>.
        </p>
      </legend>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/img/d4.svg" />
      <legend>
        <p>
          Two points on the timeline, defining an interval, where the last point
          is not exactly defined. This is a <em>terminus post</em>, like
          <em>after 31 AD</em>.
        </p>
      </legend>
    </figure>
    <p>
      So, here is our model: it has either 0 points, when unknown; or 1 or 2
      points. Each of these point is an object, having its own properties.

        More on the date model
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>A point in the date has these properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>value</strong>: the numeric value of the point. Its
          interpretation depends on other points properties: it may represent a
          year or a century, or a span between two consecutive Gregorian years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>isCentury</strong>: true if value is a century number; false
          if it's a Gregorian year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>isSpan</strong>: true if the value is the first year of a pair
          of two consecutive years. This is used for calendars which span across
          two Gregorian years, e.g. 776/5 BC.
        </li>
        <li><strong>month</strong>: the month number (1-12) or 0.</li>
        <li><strong>day</strong>: the day number (1-31) or 0.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>isApproximate</strong>: true if the point is approximate
          ("about", "ca.").
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>isDubious</strong>: true if the point is dubious ("perhaphs").
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>hint</strong>: a short textual hint used to better explain or
          motivate the datation point.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a sample, consider the expression cited above
        <em>367/366 B.C.? - ca. 150 A.D. (Roman copy)</em>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>

      <blockquote>Playing with datation</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Here you can play with an editor for this model. The default date set in
      this editor is "367/366 B.C.? - ca. 150 A.D. (Roman copy)"; a real-world
      example drawn from SEG 46,1531. This represents a range, where the first
      point is a year spanning across two years of our Gregorian calendar
      (367-366 BC), and it's dubious; the second point instead is placed
      somewhat around 150 AD.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can enter a date using a simple syntax, or edit the date visually, by
      opening the visual editor with the arrow button. Usually, you start with
      the visual editor to get to know the syntax, and later directly use that
      syntax, which is faster and more compact. When you enter a new value, its
      corresponding model is here shown below the editor. The numeric value
      shown next to the date is its computed, approximate value used for sorting
      or filtering.

      <blockquote>Composing data, composing UI</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      The above example also shows another essential concept in the Cadmus
      architecture: not only data, but also its editing UI is composable. So,
      whenever you need to enter a date in your data editor, you will just have
      to include its editor in your UI, just like now we included it in this
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows building data models and their editing UIs by pieces, with a
      high level of reuse, resulting in a more uniform architecture and faster
      development.
