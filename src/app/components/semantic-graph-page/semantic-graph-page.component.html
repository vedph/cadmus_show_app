      <blockquote>Connecting monads</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      As we have seen, our objects, the parts, are somewhat "monadic" models.
      They must be self-contained and independent, because they need to be
      composed into items; and they need to be reused across different items.
      It's right their independency which makes them fit to reuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, many entities defined by parts can enter a complex set of relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, consider a manuscript. To start with, we want to fully
      describe all the features we think relevant for such object. To this end,
      we can use a lot of parts for its material features, textual content,
      decorations, bindings, watermarks, etc. These are the objects in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, we also have a lot of relations involving a manuscript: a manuscript
      can be commissioned; written; decorated; sold; attached to a letter sent
      to a person, etc. Of course, there's no limit to such relationships. So,
      where should we store all of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      For sure, we can't make them properties of our monadic objects; because we
      don't want to pollute our model with non-intrinsic data. The fact that a
      manuscript at a certain point of its history gets sent to a person is not
      something we want to cram into objects like material description,
      decoration, binding, or the like. These are all features which are totally
      independent from that event, and exist without it. So, our objects are not
      the right place for them. Otherwise, we would stick together with scotch
      tape two objects to represent a relation between them. Once we have done
      this, we could no more put the first object in a box without carrying the
      second one together with it.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>An upper shelf</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      So, we want relations outside and above our objects, stuffed into their
      boxes; at a higher abstraction level, a sort of "upper shelf". This shelf
      will host a deeply, interconnected network of relations; and
      unsurprisingly, it will have a form of an RDF graph. This will provide the
      network connecting all our objects and/or their parts together, even
      outside the boundaries of our database.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spirit of Cadmus, we still want to preserve a simple user
      experience. After all, that's one of the reasons for modeling records as
      boxes with any type of object inside, and providing a free model and UI
      for each object. Usually, human operators do not think in terms of highly
      normalized and fragmented information; rather, they tend to group a set of
      strictly interconnected data together, just like the old paper forms some
      of them were used to.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Cadmus provides users with a similar experience: they edit different
      sets of features for each object, each in its own UI. For a manuscript, he
      may want to edit all the features connected to shelfmark identification;
      bindings; watermarks; codicological units; sheet signatures like
      numberings or catchwords; decorations; etc. At the same time, we want to
      be able to "project" some of the features of these objects, and/or the
      objects themselves, into a higher level plane, where each entity is
      modeled as the node of a graph, representing their relationships. This
      way, we would provide the best user experience from both worlds:
      human-friendly data models and UI on one side, and highly networked data
      on another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sense, just like we can use Cadmus to generate complex TEI documents
      by just filling some web forms without knowing anything about XML, we can
      use it to generate semantic graphs in exactly the same way, without doing
      anything more than filling the same forms; and without having to know
      about RDF.

      <blockquote>Leveraging index for projection</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      In short, this is implemented by leveraging the indexes which are
      automatically updated whenever an object gets saved. As we have seen,
      these are based on so-called
      <a routerLink="/docs/infrastructure">"data pins"</a>, i.e.
      name/value pairs coming from each object to represent all the features
      relevant for real-time indexing and search.
