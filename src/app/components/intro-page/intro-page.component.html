    <h2>What Is Cadmus?</h2>
    <p>It is somewhat easier to start with saying what Cadmus is not.</p>
    <p>
      Cadmus is <em>not</em> a prebuilt set of models you are forced to embrace
      to create your content. Rather, it is just a framework where you can place
      your own data models, together with their editing UI. So, these models are
      totally up to you. The architecture is designed to provide the skeleton to
      be embodied by the flesh of your own content, to provide a quicker path to
      its creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cadmus is <em>not</em> an encoding format, too. In fact, its underlying
      storage technology is handled through an abstraction, so it can be
      replaced with anything else at any moment, without affecting the other
      layers in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although mostly used with texts, Cadmus is <em>not</em> a text annotation
      system. It is content-agnostic, so you can well add text with any number
      of different and complex annotations (critical apparatus, orthography,
      abbreviations, paleographic features, comments, and whatever you might
      think of). Yet, text here is not a privileged structure bearing all the
      data connected to it, as it usually is the case with markup technologies
      like XML. Any type of content, either textual, meta-textual, or
      non-textual, can be equally created whithin the system, and whatever its
      nature it shares a common architecture. In fact, some of the projects
      adopting Cadmus have no textual content at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cadmus is <em>not</em> usually targeted to direct publication. It belongs
      to the content creation stage of a project, and everything in it is
      optimized for this purpose. It aims to provide a user-friendly environment
      for collaborative, web-based content creation, whatever the models of your
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cadmus is <em>not</em> the solution fit for any problem. It's just a
      content-creation framework which may come handy whenever a high level of
      structure is required, and more traditional approaches would suffer from a
      number of issues connected to the nature of the project, its data, or its
      team skills. In a more traditional content creation process of Scholarly
      Digital Editions, a “text-centric” perspective is often responsible of the
      persistence of a “book paradigm” in its digital reincarnation. At least
      when producing content, we essentially deal with a text which flows from
      paper to a digital document with annotations (XML), to be then published
      to HTML via XSLT. Here, the tree structure laid on the text bears the
      whole data universe. This is consistent with the typical usages of TEI,
      essentially oriented to the “reconstruction of documents”. Yet, in some
      cases, especially with the outgrow of data provided by new types of
      analysis (e.g. morphological, syntactical or metrical tagging), and/or
      when handling very complex documents (e.g. inscriptions or complex
      literary traditions), this may not be the most efficient paradigm for
      creating content. In such scenarios a paradigm shift might be beneficial;
      and Cadmus aims to provide at least a concrete example of a tool which can
      effectively implement this shift in real-world projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, Cadmus is not going to replace your preferred models or
      technologies. It is just going to eventually support them, by providing a
      rapid development framework for creating highly structured content,
      without having to train users in the usage of any specific technology. In
      fact, users are totally shielded from the underlying technologies; they
      just enter data in some web forms. Cadmus is more content-centric than
      technology-oriented; it focuses on domain models, rather than on the
      details of their digital encoding.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, for instance TEI might well be a product derived from Cadmus' content;
      but as the outcome of a more articulated production flow, rather than its
      starting point. Thinking textual, meta-textual or non-textual content
      beyond the technological and mental markup constraints allows freeing
      scholars from a number of practical issues (e.g. apparatus and workarounds
      like stand-off), letting them focus on their logical rather than physical
      models. Also, in creating content we should emphasize the typical
      requirements of any modern content editing infrastructure, like
      centralization, robustness, real-time validation and search, web-based
      concurrent editing, etc., which are very difficult to be met when dealing
      with text files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in this context Cadmus is not even a point-to-point comprehensive
      solution; it rather stands at the center of a content production flow,
      which according to the complexity of the project may imply a number of
      preprocessing and import stages before it; and a number of indexing,
      transformations and exports after it. For some of these stages, e.g.
      importing legacy, often low-structured digital data, some solutions like
      my ProteusTODOREF are designed to work side by side with it. At any rate,
      Cadmus is the editing framework which works on content, either from
      scratch, or derived from something else; and then usually produces
      something else in the context of a longer flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Vs Presentation</h2>
    <p>
      It is crucial to notice that the approach used here implies that the
      database used in entering data is usually distinct from the one (if any)
      used to publish them. For instance, a typical use case is represented by a
      web application targeting end users, and drawing its data from a
      traditional RDBMS backend. In this scenario, the RDBMS database will be an
      automatic product of the data editing database; but the two databases are
      kept distinct, because they serve different purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When entering data, we privilege an architecture widely <em>open</em> to
      expansion, with <em>dynamic</em> and <em>modular</em> modelling, and
      mostly fit to the <em>requirements</em> and habits of the scholars
      involved in the project. When publishing data instead, we will usually
      switch to a more rigid structure, typically implemented with a RDBMS,
      including any type of indexing and remodelling useful for the purposes of
      data publication and sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, the relational database of this sample is just one of the
      possible outputs derived from Cadmus content. For instance, another one
      would be TEI, automatically built from the texts and their metadata in the
      NoSql database. Also, the same could apply to any other entity we might
      want to extract from the content, for instance to transform it in terms of
      triples, using standard ontologies for their vocabulary. This has the
      advantage of letting scholars work with their own data models, in a
      bottom-up approach, where they just fill a number of different web forms,
      and then generate from them a full export by selecting, transforming and
      outputting RDF-based resources just like RDBMS or XML-TEI. In more general
      terms, this workflow resembles the well-known trend towards a more and
      more evident separation between the content and its presentations and
      usages; for instance, in many popular software models we distinguish
      between the underlying model and logic on one side, and the view
      representing the user interface on the other side. Often, the mediator
      between these two sides is represented by a viewmodel, i.e. an adaptation
      of the model to the requirements of a specific view, presenting it with a
      well defined way and interactive behavior. Using this analogy, we could
      think of Cadmus native data as the model, defined only according to the
      domain requirements, with no specific constraint posed by a specific
      serialization technology or intended presentation; then, a task-oriented
      RDBMS derived from it would represent a viewmodel, serving the view we
      want to use as our presentation, in its widest meaning, from an end-user,
      interactive web application to a direct data sharing scenario via RDF or
      web API.
