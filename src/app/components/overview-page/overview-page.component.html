    <h2>General Concepts</h2>
    <p>
      Here you can find a directory of Cadmus-related learning materials,
      together with the list of all its GitHub repositories and real-world
      projects using it.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Read and play</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      This site has been designed to be <em>simple</em> and to the point,
      leaving out most of technical and methodological discussions. It also
      provides a lot of interactivity in its pages, where users can play with
      the concepts illustrated, and even prepare some digital resources for
      using the system. In fact, technically this is a web application, rather
      than just a bunch of hypertexts.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Contents</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      The documentation found in these pages focuses on the most relevant Cadmus
      topics. You can find a more detailed
      <a href="https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_doc" target="_blank"
        >technical documentation</a
      >
      in the GitHub repositories. The main topics covered here are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/docs/data-architecture">data architecture</a>: an
        overview of the data architecture, introducing key terms in Cadmus lingo
        like items and parts, in the context of dynamic modelling built by
        composition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/docs/text-architecture">text architecture</a>: more
        focus on how text and metatextual data are handled in Cadmus. In fact, a
        radical departure from traditional markup here is that text has any
        number of separate, independent layers on top of it, including any type
        of metadata, each with its model; and that text is just a datum like any
        other, sharing the same architecture of the whole system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/docs/taxonomies">taxonomies</a>: a short discussion
        about taxonomies and shared vocabularies, freely defined and available
        across all the editors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/docs/infrastructure">infrastructure</a>: as Cadmus
        relies on databases rather than on file system, it can provide a robust,
        full-fledged editing environment, with all the features typically
        expected from a content creation system. Here you can find more about
        the general software architecture, and infrastructural features like
        real-time indexing and search.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/profile">profile</a>: your data architecture, and the
        corresponding editing UIs, are configured in an external JSON document,
        including all the data required by the system to fit your own project.
        Here I introduce the main sections of the profile, which you can
        directly create and edit in this site using the
        <a routerLink="/profile/flow">profile builder</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/models">models shop</a>: finally, you can get a general
        feeling of the Cadmus editing experience by exploring the data models
        and their user interfaces in this sort of models shop. In fact, that's
        not only a metaphor, as Cadmus projects are built by composing data
        models and their editors, focusing on sharing and reuse.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>GitHub Repositories</h2>
    <p>
      All the Cadmus repositories are public and hosted at the
      <a href="https://github.com/vedph/" target="_blank">VeDPH GitHub</a>. They
      are usually organized per-project: a set of general repositories provide
      the full infrastructure, and then each project has its own set of
      repositories.
    </p>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Repos and projects</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      The number of repositories per project depends on the projects
      requirements; usually, a full-fledged Cadmus project can have a
      documentation repository, a models repository, an API repository, and a
      frontend web app repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these repositories represent a very limited portion of the code, as
      most functionality is directly borrowed from the framework. In fact, some
      projects may even provide just a wrapper for the backend API and the
      frontend app (with their own homepage being the only resource typically
      built ad-hoc), as they mostly reuse components and even data models.
    </p>
    <h2>Docker Images</h2>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>Running and deployment</blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>
      All the images for the various Cadmus-based projects are public and hosted
      in the
      <a href="https://hub.docker.com/orgs/vedph2020" target="_blank"
        >VeDPH Docker Hub</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to play with a Cadmus project or setup it on a server is
      just downloading a Docker-compose script and run it, whatever your
      platform (Linux, Windows, or Mac). No dependencies are needed except for
      Docker itself.

    <h2>Video Presentations</h2>
    <h3>Presenting Cadmus</h3>
    <p>
      Daniele Fusi, Presenting Cadmus: a general-purpose and modular content
      editing alternative. Seminar delivered in English by Daniele Fusi (Venice
      Centre for Digital and Public Humanities) on March 25, 2020 held ON LINE
      within the VeDPH seminar series Seminars in Digital and Public Humanities.

    <h3>Encoding a critical apparatus</h3>
    <p>
      Daniele Fusi and Daniel Kiss, Encoding a critical apparatus. Webinar held
      ON LINE in December 7, 2020 within the Webinar series in Theories and
      Practices of the Annotation through Domain-Specific Languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seminar focuses on the challenge of remodelling legacy digital
      content to create highly structured digital critical editions, by using my
      Proteus conversion system coupled with Cadmus as the target content
      editor. The real-world usage case is represented here by Daniel Kiss
      <a
        href="http://www.catullusonline.org/CatullusOnline/index.php"
        target="_blank"
        >Catullus Online</a
      >, where the apparatus is being remodelled also in the perspective of
      major integration with resources like
      <a href="https://mizar.unive.it/mqdq/public/">Musisque Deoque</a>. A
      deeper insight in critical apparatus can be found in the above video.

    <h2>The Cadmus Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Here you can find a list of Cadmus-based projects, with the links to their
      corresponding GitHub repositories. All these projects are under
      development, so most of them do not yet have an official website. Where
      models are missing, this just means that these projects have no specific
      model on their own, but rather reuse general-purpose or other projects
      models (see the <a routerLink="/models/graph">models graph</a>).
