# Chronotopes

A place/date pair.

## Model

The model includes a place and a historical date. As this is a general purpose part, no assumption is made about the convention used for defining places: the place value is a string, which could be a conventional name, a place ID (e.g. a URI), etc.; this is up to the project.

Additionally, both place and date can have an assertion, which defines the certainty level of its value, and may include a set of references supporting or discussiong that assertion. The assertion in turn is a general sub-model, recurring in other parts.
