# Metadata

## Model

The metadata part is a general purpose part collecting a list of generic metadata in the form of name/value pairs. Each entry in the list has a name, a value, and a data type (e.g. string, number, etc.).

The part can be used as a quick way of attaching metadata to items, especially when they are very simple and/or non systematic.
