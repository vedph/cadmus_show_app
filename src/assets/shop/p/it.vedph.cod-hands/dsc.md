# Codicology - Manuscript's Hands

This model contains the synthetic descriptions of all the hands in a manuscript.

## Model

For each hand the model separates its instances, whatever their location in the manuscript, from its description. Descriptions can be linked to different instances, thus avoiding redundancy. The model also includes manuscript's subscriptions, which of course are strictly related to hands detection and identification.
