# Comment

## Model

This is essentially a free text comment, with some structured endpoints like document references, external resources IDs, categories, and keywords. As such, it often acts as a bridge between traditional and more structured data. This model is available as a part (when a single comment is attached to the item as a whole), or as a frament in a comments layer part (when any number of comments are linked to specific portions of a base text).

## Editor

The editor is organized into four sections: comment, references, categories, and keywords.

The comment section contains the comment's rich text (using Markdown). A preview is available at its bottom. Eventually, a comment can be further tagged to group it in some meaningful way.

The reference section contains any number of short documental references related to the comment. Also, it can include any number of IDs pointing to external resources, like web pages, entity identifiers, etc.

The categories section contains a predefined hierarchical set of categories you can assign to the comment. The set comes from a thesaurus, which can be edited at any time.

The keywords section contains a set of keywords, usually organized into different subsets, like the different indexes at the end of a printed book. Each keyword has a language and a value, plus an optional grouping (with index and/or tag) and note.
