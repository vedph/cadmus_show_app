# Attachments

This part lists all the attachments linked to a document.

## Model

Each attachment has a type (manuscript, letter, etc.) and an arbitrary name, plus an optional, arbitrary ID and any number of external IDs.

If the attachment represents only a portion of the object it belongs to (e.g. only a part of a manuscript, or only a part of a work), then its portion can be specified.

Also, an attachment can be lost or otherwise unknown.

## Editor

The editor has a list of all the attachments; you can add new attachments by clicking the `add` button.

Each of the attachments listed can be edited, moved, or deleted using the buttons next to it in the list.

When editing, the attachment editor appears below the list.
