# Codicology - Manuscript's Contents

## Model

This model lists the manuscript's contents. Each content description covers a range of sheets and a set of metadata about the work. A special field (conventionally named eid = entity ID) provides a way of attaching a unique identifier to each work.

Additionally, each content may include a set of annotations scattered in different sheets.
