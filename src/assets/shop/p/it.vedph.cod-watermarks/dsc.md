# Codicology - Manuscript's Watermarks

## Model

The model lists the watermarks found in the manuscript, each spanning across a specific range of sheets and having a synthetic description. Most important, each watermark can be linked to any number of external identifiers, usually taken from scholarly repertoires like [Briquet](https://briquet-online.at/) and [Piccard](https://www.piccard-online.de/).
