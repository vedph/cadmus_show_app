# Document References

## Model

General purpose documentary references. The model is generic enough to fit different types of references, like modern bibliography, manuscript shelfmarks, archive signatures, ancient sources citations, etc. To this end, it provides a single citation in the form of a string, whose convention depends on the reference type.

Each reference can be additionally classified with a tag, and have a short note.
