# Renovella - Tale Info

## Model

This model is specific to the Renovella project, and represents essential metadata about a tale, or about a collection of tales. In the former case the tale usually belongs to a collection (referenced by its ID); in the latter case, the collection has an ID representing the container of many tales.

Essential metadata for each tale or collection include cited persons with their structured names, identifications, and documental references, dedicatee, place and/or date, and other metadata.
