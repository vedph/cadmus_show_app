# Codicology - Manuscript Bindings

## Model

This model provides a very synthetic description of the manuscript's current binding, and eventually of its preceding bindings, when preserved. The description is rather minimalistic, as most projects do not require a higher level of detail: it includes materials, eventual place and/or date with their assertion and references, physical size, and a generic description.
