- rows (CodRow[]):
  - id*: this is the row's ID, like 1r. While it could be easily calculated from the row's position, we prefer an explicit ID because this is safer while editing: it's the real ID of each record representing a row.
  - columns (CodColumn[]):
    - id*: this is the column ID: as above, we prefer an explicit ID because these data are subject to editing. The ID is arbitrarily assigned following a set of conventions (see below).
    - value: the value in the cell.
    - note: an optional short note.
- nDefinitions (CodNColDefinition[]):
  - id* (string): the column ID.
  - rank (short): a generic rank property which defines the rank for N definitions of the same type: e.g. the main numbering has rank=1, the second has rank=2, etc. Two numberings might also have the same rank if neither prevails. Also, this has the advantage of allowing several columns for quires, signatures, etc. should this be ever required because of different conflicting descriptions.
  - isPagination (boolean)
  - system* (string, ðŸ“š cod-numbering-systems)
  - technique* (string, ðŸ“š cod-numbering-techniques)
  - position* (string, ðŸ“š cod-numbering-positions)
  - colors (string[], ðŸ“š cod-numbering-colors)
  - date (HistoricalDate)
  - note (string)
- cDefinitions (CodCColDefinition[]):
  - id* (string): the column ID.
  - rank (short)
  - position* (string, ðŸ“š cod-catchwords-positions)
  - isVertical (boolean)
  - decoration (string)
  - note (string)
- sDefinitions (CodSColDefinition[]):
  - id* (string): the column ID.
  - rank (short)
  - system* (string, ðŸ“š cod-quiresig-systems)
  - position* (string, ðŸ“š cod-quiresig-positions)
  - note (string)
- rDefinitions (CodRColDefinition[]):
  - id* (string): the column ID.
  - rank (short)
  - position* (string, ðŸ“š cod-quiresig-positions)
