# Codicology - Manuscript's Decorations

This part provides a way for listing the main features of the decorations found in a manuscript. While a highly specialized database would rather make each decoration an item, providing more details in its different parts, this is often enough for the requirements of most projects.

## Model

The model contains a list of decorations, each with its constitutive elements. Structuring each decoration into elements allows a more granular model, where key parts of each decoration can be outlined and later used for defining higher level patterns, or just searching for specific decoration features. Image references can also be attached to each of these elements.

Each decoration can also have a list of artists (either identified or not) and one of chronotopes, i.e. definitions of their place and/or date, with different certainty levels.
