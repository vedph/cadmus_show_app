# Codicology - Manuscript's Material Description

## Model

The model is a collection of *codicological units* ("a sample of folios or queries whose production can be regarded a unic operation, realised in the same conditions" of place, time, technics - Muzerelle 1985). Each unit may have an entity identifier, and contains essential metadata about its material, format, state, range of sheets covered, and location and datation hypotheses.

Also included is a list of palimpsest sheets.
