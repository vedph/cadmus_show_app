  <p>
    A general-purpose Markdown text note, with an optional tag. The backend
    makes no assumption about the text format; the frontend uses a Markdown text
    to add formatting. An HTML preview is shown in real time as the text gets
    typed. At the right side of the text box a text minimap is shown.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are required to enter some text for the note. Otherwise, just delete the
    whole note part.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tag can be used to group or categorize each note in any way. If using a
    tags thesaurus, this will be a dropdown list with a closed set to pick from.
    Otherwise, it will be a text box.
