# Keywords

## Model

The part is a collection of index keywords. Each keyword has:

- `language`: language (usually an [ISO 639 3-letters code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3)).
- `value`: keyword value.

## Editor

The editor shows a list of existing keywords at its bottom. Each of them has a delete button for removing it.

To add a new keyword, in the top area of the editor select a language and type the keyword, then click the `add` button.
