    - n* (int): sheet number.

    - value (float)
    - unit (string)

  - rulingTechnique (string, thesaurus)
  - counts (DecoratedCount[]): any number of counts. This allows entering any number of counts with different levels of precision. For instance, you might have rowMinCount, rowMaxCount, lineCount, approxLineCount, lineMinCount, lineMaxCount, prickCount, etc. It also allows descriptions for properties like columns, direction, blanks, ruling, execution, etc., eventually with a count (which might represent an average, or the most frequent value, etc.).
