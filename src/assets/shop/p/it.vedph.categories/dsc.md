# Categories

## Model

The categories part is a collection of 1 or more categories assigned to the parent item. For instance, you might have an epigraphic corpus with categories like funerary, honorary, decree, law, etc.

Each category is identified by a string, defined in a corresponding thesaurus. The thesaurus can be structured to represent a hierarchy, by using dots as level separators in the IDs, and colons for their corresponding values (the latter is merely a convention, but is useful to shorten long hierarchy paths).

## Editor

When editing a part, the categories are shown in a tree representing their hierarchy. You can freely walk the tree, expanding and collapsing its nodes, or find nodes by typing any part of their names. Once you find the desired category, just click on it to add it to the part.

The list of the categories currently added to the part is shown at the bottom. You can remove any of these categories by clicking on the delete button next to each category listed.

Note that the categories part should include at least 1 category. You will not be allowed to save an empty categories part (which would be meaningless). If you want to remove all the categories, just remove the whole categories part.
