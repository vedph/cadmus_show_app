# Chronology Layer

The chronology layer fragment contains a chronological indication linked to a specific portion of text where this indication is explicit or can be inferred.

## Model

The fragment contains a date, modeled as the date in the historical date part, a label (e.g. "battle of Marathon"), and an optional tag, representing some sort of classification for the chronological indication (e.g. "battle", "treatise", "priesthood", etc.).

Also, an optional event ID is provided to allow linking this date to an external reference (e.g. an events ontology).

## Editor

The editor couples essential data about the event (a classification tag and a label) with a datation, edited as in the historical date part.
